# travelwebsite



Hello world.

This is a travel website which contains menu like home, about us, packages, booking, rental, contact.

It has back-end features like booking form, rental form, contact form.

NOTE: This website should be uploaded to server in order to access all the features of the website.

All the forms here will send mail to both the user and the admin when it is uploaded to server (I have used local host serever to run these files).

Happy coding :)
